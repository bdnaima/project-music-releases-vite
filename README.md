### The Problem 😈

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

Problem: We had problems mostly with merging our work.

How we solved it: comparing with the previous working branches helped us solved it. we tried to merge our work as soon as we finish to work on a branch. Communicated via slack for quick questions. 

Planning:- Planned on Trello: started with Basic requirements and then worked with intermitted and then Advance goal.

Tech used: Trello, Slack, Zoom and Goggle meet.

If we had more time:- we could have create a popup that would show the album when user clicks on any of the music playlist and maybe we could have used more css animation and styled to make it look better.
